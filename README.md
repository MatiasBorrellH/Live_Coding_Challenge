# Live Coding Challenge

This repository is dedicated to a submission of the live coding challenge for the coding part of the DSDM brushup course.

In this repository you'll find mainly two things:
1.  A folder called [data](data/) containing World Bank datasets, mostly on education for analysis,
2.  A [Jupyter Notebook](live_code.ipynb) with a pipeline to clean the WB data, analyze and visualize it and finally feed it into a statistical model (Panel OLS and OLS).

The actual regressions are rather meaningless but here for the sake of constructing a pipeline.
